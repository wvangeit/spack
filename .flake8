# flake8 settings for Spack core files.
#
# These exceptions ar for Spack core files. We're slightly more lenient
# with packages.  See .flake8_packages for that.
#
# Let people line things up nicely:
# - E129: visually indented line with same indent as next logical line
# - E221: multiple spaces before operator
# - E241: multiple spaces after ','
# - E272: multiple spaces before keyword
#
# Let people use terse Python features:
# - E731: lambda expressions
#
# These are required to get the package.py files to test clean:
# - F999: syntax error in doctest
#
# Exempt to allow decorator classes to be lowercase, but follow otherwise:
# - N801: CapWords for class names.
