Spack is a multi-platform package manager that builds and installs
multiple versions and configurations of software. It works on Linux,
macOS, and many supercomputers. Spack is non-destructive: installing a
new version of a package does not break existing installations, so many
configurations of the same package can coexist.

Spack offers a simple "spec" syntax that allows users to specify versions
and configuration options. Package files are written in pure Python, and
specs allow package authors to write a single script for many different
builds of the same package.  With Spack, you can build your software
*all* the ways you want to.

See the
[Feature Overview](http://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/features.html)
for examples and highlights.

To install spack and your first package, make sure you have Python.
Then:

    $ git clone https://github.com/spack/spack.git
    $ cd spack/bin
    $ ./spack install libelf

### Contributions

Contributing to Spack is relatively easy.  Just send us a
[pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).
When you send your request, make ``develop`` the destination branch on the
[Spack repository](https://github.com/spack/spack).

Your PR must pass Spack's unit tests and documentation tests, and must be
[PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) compliant.  We enforce
these guidelines with [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/spack/spack).  To
run these tests locally, and for helpful tips on git, see our
[Contribution Guide](http://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contribution_guide.html).

Spack uses a rough approximation of the
[Git Flow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)
branching model.  The ``develop`` branch contains the latest
contributions, and ``master`` is always tagged and points to the latest
stable release.
