"""Check that Spack complies with minimum supported python versions.

We ensure that all Spack files work with Python2 >= 2.6 and Python3 >= 3.0.

We'd like to drop 2.6 support at some point, but there are still many HPC
systems that ship with RHEL6/CentOS 6, which have Python 2.6 as the
default version.  Once those go away, we can likely drop 2.6 and increase
the minimum supported Python 3 version, as well.
